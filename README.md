# PREVENTION OF LOAN DEFAULTS IN BANKING THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

This project predicts clients’ suitability to receive bank loans using supervised learning. The data is preprocessed, and models such as K-NN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM are applied, optimizing accuracy while minimizing false positives—an essential factor for reducing financial risk.

## Description

We use the `Statlog (German Credit Data)` dataset to predict individuals’ creditworthiness. The dataset includes numerical, categorical, and ordinal variables. We implement four main algorithms:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

The goal is to optimize model accuracy, with a particular emphasis on reducing the number of false positives.

## Dataset

The dataset contains credit and financial information from individuals in the German economy. Variables were preprocessed by removing redundancies and biases. For more details, the dataset is available in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data).

## Tools

1. **Python**
2. **Scikit-learn (for modeling)**
3. **Pandas and NumPy (for data handling)**
4. **GridSearchCV and StratifiedKFold (for hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation)**
